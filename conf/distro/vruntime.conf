# VRuntime - Minimal distro for vdkr/vpdmn container runtime environments
#
# This distro is used by multiconfig builds (vruntime-aarch64, vruntime-x86-64)
# to create minimal rootfs images for QEMU-based container processing.
#
# The resulting images contain Docker or Podman tools and are used by
# vrunner.sh to import containers during Yocto image builds.

# Minimal distro features for container runtime environment
# - acl: Access control lists (containers need this)
# - ext2: Filesystem support
# - ipv4/ipv6: Network support for container networking
# - seccomp: Security for container isolation
# - vfat: For potential boot partition support
# - pci: PCI device support (virtio devices)
# - vcontainer: Enable vdkr/vpdmn kernel config fragments (9p, squashfs, overlayfs)
#
# Explicitly NOT included: x11, wayland, pulseaudio, bluetooth, wifi, nfc, 3g, pcmcia
